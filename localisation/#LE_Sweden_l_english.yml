  le_SWE.12.d:0 "The Swedish king has publically announced his support for us, clearly showing he does not want us to return to russian tyranny. Today, a formal letter was recieved from the Swedish embassy stating that he offers to reassemble us and the Estonians in to a new Duchy of Livonia inside the great Kingdom of Sweden. This would affectively force the russians to leave our terratorry, as to not provoke the Swedish into joining the civil war and tipping the scales. We are in a dire situation, but is it dire enough for us to give up on the Lithuanian cause?"

Today, a formal letter was recieved from the Swedish embassy stating that he offers to reassemble us and the Latvians in to a new Duchy of Livonia inside the great Kingdom of Sweden. This would affectively force the russians to leave our terratorry, as to not provoke the Swedish into joining the civil war and tipping the scales.

As of our current situation we could not affort fighting the swedish, and the few troops located in those areas were immediatly ordered to retreat and let the swedish in"

  le_SWE.20.t:0 "Their deed is official"
  le_SWE.20.d:0 "It is now official. We had earlier gotten reports from local generals that sweden had been moving into russian terratory, and we also had to stop our advances into the baltic, as they had been "Placed under protection" by Sweden. This was however all secret, and only Swedish and Russian generals were aware of this, most hoping that when the civil war concludes the terratories be reverted. However, this morning the Swedish king, together with the regent of Swedis Finland, and the Livonian duchy, wrote a formal letter to the press. In witch they state to the public that they have moved in to protect their fellow baltic people from the graps of russian tyranny, and that the lands where now integral parts of Sweden. Nothing russian will be allowed to remain. This statement is outrageous, and we can not allow them to this to us and our lands!"
  le_SWE.20.a:0 "We have more important matters in our hands, but they should know this won't last for long"

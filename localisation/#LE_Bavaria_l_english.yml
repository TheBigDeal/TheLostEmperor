le_bavaria.2.t:0 "Riots in Munich, Terror Attack at Military Base"
le_bavaria.2.d:0 "Today in the early morning there were riots in Munich following a rally by the Bavarian Communist Party (BKP). The rally started off peacefully but quickly got more and more heated. Eventually a group of the atendees split off and started breaking windows and causing trouble, eventually they stopped and left. However the damage was already done, the police were called and tensions started to rise. Eventually an officer, scared for his life ended up shooting a prominant party member who was trying to calm down the rioters. Afterwards all hell broke loose. Police were attacked, protestors were shot. The gathering was dispersed but other gatherings started showing up around the city. Before you knew it every street corner had rioters breaking windows, throwing fire bombs, breaking property. In the chaos many stores were robbed as well. Then the military was called. While they were getting ready to head into the fire, a bomb went off in one of the barracks, killing around 150 men and wounding 80 others. After the initial panick the remainder of the military went into the city. Upon their arrival most of the riots were dispersed, while some had to be forced to disperse."

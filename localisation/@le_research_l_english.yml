 ### RESEARCH TOOLTIPS ###
 infomation_antiair_TOOLTIP:0 "Self Propelled Anti Aircraft Guns (SPG's) are mobile weapons, designed similar to tanks, with the sole purpose of hunting down enemy aircraft. These weapons can also be effective against infantry, but can be destroyed easily as well because of their weak armor."
 infomation_antiair_TOOLTIP_delayed:0 "§G+       Soft Attack\n +++  Anti Aircraft Capabillity\n §R---     Hardness\n ---     Piercing§!"
 
 infomation_SPG_TOOLTIP:0 "Self Propelled Guns (SPG's) are mobile artillery guns. Used mainly against infantry or enemy buildings, these vehilcles can decimate landscapes. Firing huge shells with tons of explosive payload, nothing is safe. These tanks are not very reliable, or as great at hunting tanks. But against infantry and buildings they excel."
 infomation_SPG_TOOLTIP_delayed:0 "§G++   Soft Attack\n ++   Breakthrough\n §R-       Hardness\n -       Piercing\n -       Production Cost§!"
 
 infomation_light_TOOLTIP:0 "Light Tanks are fast moving tanks, as one would expect. They do not offer much light armor, or much firepower, but they are good protecting infantry and advancing quickly into enemy territory."
 infomation_light_TOOLTIP_delayed:0 "§G+      Soft Attack\n++    Movement Speed\n§R-       Hardness\n-       Piercing§!"
 
 infomation_early_TOOLTIP:0 "Armor was developed by Great Britain in 1924. With the capacity to completely change warfare it was safeguarded until they perfected it."
 
 infomation_medium_TOOLTIP:0 "Medium Tanks are a balance between the speed of Light tanks, and the armor of Heavy tanks. Decent firepower and acceptable speed, for many nations this is the perfect balance for a armored vehicle."
 infomation_medium_TOOLTIP_delayed:0 "§G+      Hard Attack\n+      Piercing\n+      Movement Speed\n§R+       Production Cost§!"
 
 infomation_heavy_TOOLTIP:0 "Heavy Tanks are giant behemoths, made to take any damage that can be thrown at it, as well as dish out as much damage as possible. However this will usually trade off speed and production costs."
 infomation_heavy_TOOLTIP_delayed:0 "§G++      Hard Attack\n++      Piercing\n§R++      Production Cost\n-         Movement Speed§!"
 
 infomation_super_heavy_TOOLTIP:0 "Super Heavy Tanks are the extreme version of Heavy Tanks. More Armor, More Weapons, More Crew. This of course comes with the same downfalls, Much less speed, and very high production costs"
 infomation_super_heavy_TOOLTIP_delayed:0 "§G+++     Hard Attack\n+++     Piercing\n§R+++     Production Cost\n--         Movement Speed"
 
 infomation_landcruiser_TOOLTIP:0 "Landcruiser's are an experimental classification of armored vehicles. They are made to mimic a Naval Ship, but on land. These may have 50 or 60 crew members in them at once, powered by huge engines, in the count of two, four, maybe even eight engines. Multipule guns are always involved also. Because of their size they are huge targets for airplanes. But because of their size and engines they move at acceptable speeds most of the time."

 seige_cannon_desc:0 "The cannon has been used for centurties as the main weapon for demolition. In the past we developed catapults the first of their kind, then trebuchets, a large wooden machine capable of flinging 90-kilogram stones more than 300 meters away. Then upon the discovery of gunpowder, everything changed. Weapons got more destructive, as well as smaller and more portable. Today's late cannons are very capable machines, but are no match to modern day artillery."

Early tanks were armed with machineguns and small cannons, moved slowly, and were armored only enough to stop small arms fire."

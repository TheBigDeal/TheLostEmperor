 ### ARTILLERY ###
 seige_cannon:0 "Seige Cannon"
 seige_cannon_desc:0 "The cannon has been used for centurties as the main weapon for demolition. In the past we developed catapults the first of their kind, then trebuchets, a large wooden machine capable of flinging 90-kilogram stones more than 300 meters away. Then upon the discovery of gunpowder, everything changed. Weapons got more destructive, as well as smaller and more portable. Today's late cannons are very capable machines, but are no match to modern day artillery."

The name Tank was adopted by the British during the early stages of their development, as a security measure to conceal their purpose. Early tanks were armed with machineguns and small cannons, moved slowly, and were armored only enough to stop small arms fire."

 le_prussia.2.t:0 "National Announcement!"
 le_prussia.2.d:0 "Shortly after Wilhelms visit to the Capitol our king has fallen ill. After being rushed to the best Medical care Germany can provide he died. This event has caused many to think that Wilhelm has gone too far and assassinated the King. Others have come into support of Wilhelm, saying a family would never do that to eachother. \n\n After the chaos the King's will was found in his bed chambers, while the legitimacy of the document is questionable, it seems to be written by the King hisself. Once government officials found the note a meeting between the council was called. Prince Wilhelm and Prince Waldemar, the Kings son has been called to the meeting as well. \n\nRecently the note's contents have been discovered, and the fate of Prussia is Sealed."

Popularity for National Socialism has always been high, ideologies like it thrive in militaristic nations such as our great Prussia. However today nationalist protests have broken out around the country and party members have broken into the Reichstag. We can only assume the worst is to come."

It is a sad day for the country, and all Germanic Peoples.\n\nHenry will have a legacy that not many Prussian Monarchs had, he was a great diplomat, and valued all Prussian lived and those of all of Germany. One of his main goals was to unite the German Peoples into a German Nation."

 le_prussia.13.a:0 "We're Screwed."
 le_prussia.14.t:0 "Hannover Breaks Into Chaos!"
 le_prussia.14.d:0 "Today Hannover has broken out into what resembles full scale civil war. Government officials are being killed left and right, and a new government has been put into power. While this chaos is going on, it would be a good time for us to strike and take what is rightfully ours."

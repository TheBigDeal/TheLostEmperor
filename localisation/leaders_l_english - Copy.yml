 gre_description_king_albert:0 "King Alvertos I is a very unfortunate King. It isn't his fault he can't speak Greek or that he can't understand Hellenic ways. He was never meant to be the King of the Greeks; the role was thrust upon him. Yet he never shirks his responsibilities as King. Even in Greece's darkest hour, Albert I always upholds the supremacy of the constitution above all else and abhorres tyranny more than anything. He may not have been born Greek, but now that he was their King, Albert I tries to do everything he can to improve their lot."

 gbr_irish_question_desc:0 "Throughout human history there have always been several universal truths; one of those is that the Irish do not particularly like the British. Centuries of discrimination, rebellion, and anger have soured relations between the two islands. Boycotts of British goods and public protests are common and any conscription attempt of Irishmen, with the notable exception of the pro-British Ulster unionists, is met with fierce resistance. While Ireland might be stable for now some say it’s a ticking time bomb just waiting to explode."

### Events ###
 le_greece.1.t:0 "The Greek Elections of 1928"
 le_greece.1.d:0 "Elections have been a recent addition to the Greek Government. Ever since the Parliament was created in 1923 The Greeks elected a Prime minister, as well as representatives from each part of Greece. Even though they are still mostly all puppets to the King, the Prime Minister still has a say in government and what happens in the country. Today a new prime minister will be elected."
 le_greece.1.a:0 "Election Time!"
 le_greece.2.t:0 "Forming A Coalition Government"
 le_greece.2.d:0 "The day has come to elect a Prime Minister. There are four canidates. Firstly there is Eleftherios Venizelos, he is a liberal monarchist and supporter of the new parliament. He advocates for a stronger democracy, but still with a king. Secondly there is Nikos Zachariadis, he is the leader of the Hellenic Commune, and a symbol for many Greeks. Thirdly there is Georgios Tsolakoglou, he is part of the newly formed labryscist party, and the leader of the Spartan State. Lastly there is Charles Zervas, he is named after the French figurehead Charlemange, a current nationalist symbol in France. He beleives that the state should adopt a orthodox state religion and follow the old ways of the Byzantines. He still supports the monarchy, but only as hiself as the king."

 le_greece.2.II:0 "The Nationalist Georgios Tsolakoglou Wins"
 le_greece.2.III:0 "The Liberal Monarchist Eleftherios Venizelos Wins"
 le_greece.2.IV:0 "The Radical Charles Zervas Wins"
 
 le_greece.7.t:0 "Prince Constantine Returns!"
 le_greece.7.d:0 "Today word has reached the king that his rival, Prince Constantine has returned from his exile. This has caused quite a stir in Greece, causing supporters of the Prince to come out in his name. Many feel Greece is being ruled by a foreign power as the king is German born, and not Greek."
 le_greece.7.a:0 "Damn!"
 le_greece.8.t:0 "Prince Constantine Makes A Move!"
 le_greece.8.d:0 "Today the kings home in Athens was raided. In an attempt to seize power for hiself Prince Constantine has ordered his followers to oust the current king. This includes some army leaders and government officials. Tensions are high and Constantine is close to taking power. Who knows what will happen next."
 le_greece.8.a:0 "Constantine Seizes Power"
 le_greece.8.b:0 "Constantine Is Captured"
 
 
 le_greece.14.t:0 "Military Coup"
 le_greece.14.d:0 "Today high ranking Generals have been seen running around in haste, the military is on high alert and poised to launch a coup. While there are some loyal to the government still, a overwhelming majority have joined up in arms to overthrow the government. We must act quickly to crush the officers and hope the army isnt as loyal as them seem."
 le_greece.14.a:0 "The Coup Succeeds \n( §gDespotism§! Becomes The Ruling Party )"
 le_greece.14.b:0 "The Coup Fails"
 le_greece.15.t:0 "Theocratic Coup"
 le_greece.15.d:0 "The political party "The Hands Of God" has been a thorn in Greece's side for years. Starting as a minor party they have grown popular with the religous of the state. They have sensed weakness in the government, and hoping to gain Constantines support have launched a secret coup. A meeting is currently being held between the Theocrats and the King about the future of the State. Will Constantine cave under the pressure of the faith, or will be countinue ruling as a king, and be the one and only ruler of Greece?"
 le_greece.15.a:0 "Constantine Submits/n( §gTheocratic§! Becomes The Ruling Party )"
 le_greece.15.b:0 "Constantine Kicks Out The Theocrats"\
 le_greece.16.t:0 "Labor Strikes"
 le_greece.16.d:0 "Today in Athens a large portion of workers demanding better pay and working conditions have gone on strike and are refusing to work. Unfortunately, this initially peaceful demonstration has spiralled out of control with certain far-left elements becoming increasingly prevalent. With violence rising by the hour, we were forced to send in the police who forcibly broke the strike."
 le_greece.16.a:0 "How Unfortunate"
 le_greece.17.t:0 "The Loyal Legion"
 le_greece.17.d:0 "As of late a long-time subversive organization called the 'Loyal Legion' has been conducting more and more attacks on police, military, and government buildings. The Legion pushes for Prince Constantine to become the King of Greece. Yesterday, numreous pro-Constantine slogans were painted across Athens and some of our senior intelligence analysts warn that a significant number of military officers are secretly pro-Constantine. The most notable Loyal Legion activity was a bombing at the Police HQ in Athens just last week which killed seven officers and wounded thirteen more. In the rubble a picture of Constantine was found along with a slogan saying 'Long live the true King'."
 le_greece.17.a:0 "Damn Traitors"
 le_greece.18.t:0 "The King's Secert"
 le_greece.18.d:0 "It is well known that King Constantine has had many...adventures of the romantic kind. He once spent a hedonistic and well-documented weekend in Nice with several female relations of some very powerful individuals. However, as Constantine is now King his personal life is far less secretive and certain reports have reached the press that the King, in addition to his love of women has a certain...taste, so to speak, for men. While this is obviously just some silly rumor both the populace and the powerful orthodox church are worried about their King's indecent ways."
 le_greece.18.a:0 "How did this get out?!"
 
 le_greece.19.t:0 "Gyaros Island"
 le_greece.19.d:0 "Gyaros Island sits in the western part of the Aegean Sea and has hosted a small prison since the reign of Leopold II. However, by expanding the installation we can hold more dissidents and treasons citizens with a very low chance of escaping. However some are concerned that the expense will not be worth the possible public backlash."
 le_greece.19.a:0 "Expand The Prison"
 le_greece.19.b:0 "It’s Not Worth it"
 
 le_greece.20.t:0 "The Gyaros Report"
 le_greece.20.d:0 "Since our expansion of the prison complex on Gyaros island certain rumors have been circulating among our population that the prison is host to grave violations of people’s rights. Some time ago several foreign newspapers published a scathing article titled the ‘Gyaros Report’ which details what goes on at the island prison. Stories of prisoners being forced into tubs of human vomit or reports of dissidents being herded into crowded cells with cattle prods have outraged the population."

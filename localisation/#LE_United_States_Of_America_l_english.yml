 le_USA.8.t:0 "General Strike"
 le_USA.8.d:0 "They came out in droves. Anger at President Reed’s crackdown on organized labor amidst the current economic downturn both the International Workers of the World (IWW) and the American Federation of Labor (AFL), two of the largest labor organizations in the United States have set aside their differences and called a general strike in opposition to the President’s policies. From Minneapolis to Norfolk, hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of blue-collar Americans have taken to the streets of their cities to protest the failures of the current administration. The economy is slowly grinding to halt especially in the north where the labor unions are the strongest. In the south, however, where organized labor is weak, most people curse the ‘Yankee Reds’. Meanwhile, in Washington, the President has called an emergency meeting of the cabinet."
 le_USA.8.a:0 "So it begins..."
 le_USA.9.t:0 "The President's Address"
 le_USA.9.d:0 "Today, President James Reed made an address to both congress and the people over radio. ‘My fellow Americans, our nation is beset by an internal fifth column, that of the communist rabble rousers. They wish to destroy the America we hold dear, to turn it into a socialist dictatorship. They want to take away our businesses, our homes, and our livelihood. These communists wish nothing more than death and destruction for all. And I will not let this happen. America will be a beacon of liberty and the most steadfast foe of communist tyranny...’ As the President finishes his speech he comes to his final remarks. The whole nation leans in to their radios..."
 le_USA.9.a:0 "'If these socialists want a fight, I’ll give them hell.'"
 le_USA.9.b:0 "'It is important not to lose sight of the values which made our nation great.'"
 le_USA.10.t:0 "A March in Chicago"
 le_USA.10.d:0 "Shortly after the President’s announcement of a hardline stance towards the striking workers new protests were called by union leaders all across the country. The largest of which were in the left-wing stronghold of Chicago. All along Michigan Avenue, thousands of workers marched for better pay, better working conditions, and an end to the ‘War on the Working Class’ as they put it. Several notable socialists spoke at the protest, including IWW leaders Big Bill Haywood and Lucy Parsons. Socialist Party leader Eugene Debs also made a fiery speech decrying the President’s policies. However a speech by Emma Goldman calling for an effective revolution and ‘an end to capitalist exploitation’ worried even some of the protesters. A response by the authorities is awaited."
 le_USA.10.a:0 "Send in the boys in blue."
 le_USA.11.t:0 "The Chicago Riots"
 le_USA.11.d:0 "Following the government’s decision to send in police to forcibly disperse the protesters in Chicago, violence ensued. Protesters grabbed bottles, canes, umbrellas, street signs, baseball bats, and even cobblestones to repulse the police officers. Mass riots gripped the second largest city in the United States and lasted over three days before a stalemate was reached. While law enforcement holds most of the city, the rioters maintain control of the downtown area. There, Lucy Parsons declared the creation of the Chicago Commune. This has sent shockwaves throughout the US but the Federalist Governor of Illinois, Leo Small, has so far refused federal calls to send in the National Guard."
 le_USA.11.a:0 "We may need to federalize it"
 le_USA.12.t:0 "Democrats Protest"
 le_USA.12.d:0 "Following the President’s surprise turnaround on his campaign promises of being hard on unions, numerous Democrats have come out in open criticism of his policies. An open letter, signed by various high-ranking Democrats and even a few more conservative Federalists sharply criticized the the administration’s policies. Even a few fire-eater Democrats from the Deep South have called the President ‘A communist agent’ and named him as perhaps one of America’s worst leaders. President Reed has dismissed these allegations as ‘mere slander’ but already in the Capitol there are rumors of several high-profile resignations from the cabinet and some protests have broken out in the south."
 le_USA.12.a:0 "Can we negotiate at least with the socialists?"
 le_USA.13.t:0 "Clashes in Baltimore"
 le_USA.13.d:0 "Baltimore, Maryland, home of some of the largest shipyards in the United States has been the scene of a strike by shipwrights since the beginning of the General Strike. However, since the President’s shocking u-turn on his campaign promises numerous brawls have broken out between strikers and right-wing militants. However, a recent police shooting of a group of strikers that killed two led to massive protests by the shipwrights. While police have loosened their grip in response to the controversy many conservative activists have come out in support of Baltimore’s law enforcement. As time went on the brawls continued and eventually evolved into riots then full on street fights. Baltimore police has proven completely inadequate at dealing with the violence as the city falls into chaos. Far-left and far-right groups are fighting on the streets and the Governor in Annapolis has so far proven reluctant to send in the National Guard."
 le_USA.13.a:0 "We may have to federalize the National Guard."
 le_USA.14.t:0 "The President Federalizes the National Guard"
 le_USA.14.d:0 "In response to rising discontent among large segments of the population and continued bouts of violence in major cities President Reed has decided to take direct control over the states’ National Guards. As troops move into city centers to quell riots and protests many senior politicians have voiced their extreme concern about the President overreaching his authority. Federalist Senator Alf Landon delivered a scathing criticism of federal policy and called on the President to rescind his executive order. It remains to be seen the lasting effects of President Reed’s decision but so far it seems it has done little to stop the political divisions and violence within the nation."
 le_USA.14.a:0 "The hardest choices require the strongest wills."
 le_USA.15.t:0 "Chaos in the Cities"
 le_USA.15.d:0 "From Minneapolis to Baltimore chaos reigns in the cities. Strikers turned revolutionaries battle right-wing mobs while police and National Guardsmen do little to stop the violence. In Chicago almost the entire downtown area has fallen to the so-called ‘Chicago Commune’ while Pittsburgh is beset by running street battles between communists and riot police. With the situation rapidly spiraling out of control a group of military officers has approached President Reed with a plan. This clique has been nicknamed by the press as “The American Triumvirate” and consists of Generals Douglas MacArthur, Dwight D Eisenhower and Joseph Stilwell. They have been encouraging the President to declare martial law in order to restore peace to the nation."
 le_USA.15.a:0 "We’re in the endgame now."
 le_USA.16.t:0 "Martial Law Declared"
 le_USA.16.d:0 "With the United States slowly sliding towards chaos, President Reed has taken the drastic step of following the advice of the Triumvirate and has declared martial law. The military has stepped in to take control of the situation and has suspended the constitution. However there has been widespread opposition towards this move with socialist leader ‘Big’ Bill Haywood calling it ‘A cruel and illegal way of oppressing the proletariat.’ Meanwhile many southern Democrats are horrified at these blatant violation of civil rights. Some army divisions in the south have even refused to follow orders from Washington. In the capital, it is rumored that President Reed has slumped into depression with more and more functions of state being taken by members of the Triumvirate. Against the backdrop of all this chaos it is widely assumed that America is one the brink of failure."
 le_USA.16.a:0 "The Reckoning is upon us."
 le_USA.17.t:0 "Breaking News: President Hull Cheated!"
 le_USA.17.d:0 "The Washington Post has discovered a shocking revelation. In the 1928 Presidential election, then liberalism candidate Cordell Hull employed bribery, threats, and spying to ensure a majority in the electoral college. The most notable incidents occurred in New York where connections between the Hull campaign and Tammany Hall lead to endemic poll stuffing across the state which ultimately carried for Hull. Furthermore, an elector in Maine, a state which carried for the Federalists, voted for Hull and it turns out only because the elector in question was threatened with sensitive information regarding him in a compromising situation with a cross-dresser, a nun, and a potato salad. These incidents, among others, provide conclusive evidence that Cordell Hull lied and cheated his way to victory."
 le_USA.17.a:0 "This is a scoop like no other."
 le_USA.18.t:0 "A Meeting In The Dark"
 le_USA.18.d:0 "When the story broke of the elections, the President held a secret midnight meeting in the Oval Office with senior cabinet members, advisors, and congressional Democrats. After almost an hour of heated discussion, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover suggested that law enforcement declare this a matter of national security and raid the offices of the Washington Post. While this was happening, Hoover proposed destroying all other incriminating evidence in the White House. President Hull, while initially skeptical of this totally illegal plan was eventually won over and ordered Hoover to begin preparations."
 le_USA.18.a:0 "The die is cast"
 le_USA.19.t:0 "Covering Our Tracks"
 le_USA.19.d:0 "In the early hours of this morning plainclothes FBI agents entered the offices of the Washington Post newspaper with a warrant. The agents demanded to see all the information related to the allegations of election rigging. When a senior journalist refused he was arrested on the spot. It didn’t take much after that to force the other journalists to hand over their information and by midday the raid was complete. It was, however, not quiet and caused an uproar among Americans of all walks of life. Both socialists and southern Democrats demanded an answer. With still some time until the rest of the incriminating information was destroyed, President Hull had a choice. He could either risk his neck by appearing before the nation in a speech or he could remain silent."
 le_USA.19.a:0 "Hull Speaks."
 le_USA.19.b:0 "Hull Remains Silent."
 le_USA.20.t:0 "Hull Speaks"
 le_USA.20.d:0 "The whole nation is glued to their radios, listening attentively. Suddenly a word. Then more. The President is speaking. ‘My fellow Americans,’ he begins, I have served this nation for forty years. I have done everything in service to this country. I have continually upheld the American ideals of democracy and freedom. And I have never failed in that regard. I have tried my hardest to better the lives of every American. Yet, it seems some refuse to acknowledge this fact and are trying to frame me for a crime I didn’t commit. I have earned every cent. And in all of my years of public life I have never obstructed justice. People have got to know whether or not their President is a cheat. Well, I’m not a cheat. I’ve earned everything I’ve got, fair and square.’ Immediately after the address numerous lawsuits led by the Washington Post were filed against the Hull administration. The President had taken a risk and it seemed it failed."
 le_USA.20.a:0 "We can still win this."
 le_USA.21.t:0 "Hull is Silent"
 le_USA.21.d:0 "President Hull has calculated that addressing the American people is too much of a risk right now and has elected to remain silent. However this has only emboldened his enemies. Northern socialists have highlighted this incident as just one example of the failings of a capitalistic state while conservatives claim that this is evidence of the corruption of Washington. Furthermore, no less than seven lawsuits have been filed in support of the Washington Post against the administration. It seems that a legal battle is brewing- one that will only end in the Supreme Court."
 le_USA.21.a:0 "A minor hiccup to be sure."
 le_USA.22.t:0 "Stacking the Court"
 le_USA.22.d:0 "With a battle in the Supreme Court looming, President Hull has come up with a rather clever plan. He suggests that by expanding the court to fifteen justices instead of the original nine he can ensure a majority in the court. When he announced this plan there was mass outrage and riots erupted in numerous cities across the nation. But Cordell Hull was unmoved. He was determined that Washington Post V. United States go on as planned in spite of popular outrage."
 le_USA.22.a:0 "Let’s end this game."
 le_USA.23.t:0 "Washington Post v. United States"
 le_USA.23.d:0 "Following the issuance of a writ of certiorari, the case of Washington Post v. United States was rapidly pushed up to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, although outraged by the administration's controversial decision to stack the court, has nevertheless decided to push on with the court case. Following the oral arguments delivered yetsterday the court has deliberated and has sided with...the President. Mass riots have erupted all over the country as people protest this decision by an illegally stacked court. However, this has come as a huge victory for President Hull even as the clouds seem to darken over the United States."
 le_USA.23.a:0 "Nothing to see here! Nothing to see here!"
 
 le_USA.24.t:0 "The Capitol is Dark and Full of Terrors"
 le_USA.24.d:0 "Last night something unexpected happened in Washington. Black cars parked in front of major government buildings and dark suited men exited. Some gunshots were heard throughout the city as a curfew was imposed. People wondered, but they did little. As dawn rose on a Washington morning Americans discovered a cold, hard truth. Someone leaked the evidence of President Hull's cheating in the election, someone purposely sabotaged the federal raid on the Washington Post, someone has continually undermined Cordell Hull's administration. And that someone was perhaps the most elusive man in the capital- FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. His FBI agents had, by now, complete control of the capital and the neighboring area. Yet even now as Hull is disposed of and Hoover is sworn in as President, the America he knows crumbles around him. In spite of this, Hoover now leads a shattered and broken US, one that is made of knives and whispers rather than freedom and democracy. America, as it once was is gone, now it is nothing more than a state of shadows."
 le_USA.24.a:0 "Evil triumphs when good men do nothing."
 
 le_USA.25.t:0 "A National Tragedy"
 le_USA.25.d:0 "While Frank Lowden, by far the favorite, managed to secure his election as the President of the United States it was a surprisingly close race and furthermore the Democrats managed to take control of the House of Representatives- a nasty surprise for any incoming Federalist President. In fact, Lowden's whole presidency has been one nasty surprise after the next. First, Vice President Warren Harding who was a very popular running mate and probably gave Lowden the election suffered a serious stroke in the beginning of March from which he is still recovering. Next, a failure to secure a trade deal with Great Britain- a vital campaign promise- further damaged the popularity of the administration. Lastly, a confrontation was looming over next year's budget with the pugnacious Speaker of the House- John Nance Garner, a Texan immigrant- which Lowden wasn't sure he could win given Garner's fierce reputation. Could this get any worse? As it turns out it can. While traveling from the Capitol back to the White House one day an anarchist threw a small homemade explosive at the Presidential motorcade. President Lowden was severely injured and despite doctor's best efforts he fell into a coma."
 le_USA.25.a:0 "Why can't we have nice things?"
 
 le_USA.26.t:0 "Chaos In The Capital"
 le_USA.26.d:0 "Who is running the United States? That is a question nobody can seem to answer or even get a clue. With Vice President Harding still in recovery all sorts of vultures have leapt at the carcass of President Lowden's Administration. Almost immedietly after Lowden was admitted to the hospital, Secretary of State Robert La Follette declared himself Acting President. A significant number of people agreed with this decision but most forgot the last time a President was incapacitated for a significant period of time- in 1882. At that time the President, James Garfield, was succeeded by his Vice President William Forester. But when Forester fell ill and the President was still recovering from a gunshot wound the Speaker of the House, Democrat Andrew Tilden, stepped  in and assumed the role of Acting President for two months. Back to the present, with an increasing number of people claiming House Speaker Garner is the President the Virginia representative hurriedly appointed a cabinet while his opponent did the same in the White House. With both of them issuing orders to respective departments no one actually knows what the government is much less what it's actually doing."
 le_USA.26.a:0 "Can't we just all get along?"
 
 le_USA.27.t:0 "The Succession Question"
 le_USA.27.d:0 "As disorder reigns in the Capitol, Vice President Warren G Harding was declared to be sufficiently recovered from his stroke. Almost immediately, Harding announced his intention to assume the Presidency. However, neither La Follette nor Garner has backed the vice president’s claim although a few conservative Federalist congressmen have supported him. In spite of this all three of the claimants are now locked in a contest over the failing United States. With the government in a total shutdown nothing can be done to repair the nation. Departments do nothing- their staff on unpaid leave. When people don’t have jobs- like federal workers nowadays- they grumble and complain. Bored workers become radical workers. Furthermore, a quiet has set in the Capitol. There’s little hustle and bustle, just a sense of loss. Then President Lowden died."
 le_USA.27.a:0 "Is this loss?"
 
 le_USA.28.t:0 "A House Divided"
 le_USA.28.d:0 "' The United States of America'. Pfft. We are the Disunited States of America. What are we but a squabbling band of states who can’t even agree who leads us when our leader dies? Are we a democracy? No, we are nothing anymore. America has tried to crush us but here we are, proud and strong. The bourgeois think they can destroy us, but they fail to see the inevitability of socialism. Our time has come! The working class has nothing to lose but their chains! We have a world to win! Working people of America, unite!\n\n\nCheers ring out from the crowd as the speaker sits down. Amid renditions of “Solidarity Forever” the Chicago Commune is declared. Detroit follows. Then Minneapolis. Even Cleveland declares its commune. The time of America has ended but the age of chaos has begun."
